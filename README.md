This is a example software project we did in Laravvel PHP framework. The project is Rajuk Automated Development System. This project was done for Software Development lab with my project partner Ahsanul Hadi. Initial Information Systems Design was done by Samia Shafique, Tamjid-al-Rahat, Faisal Hossain Shezan and Farzia Afroze. 

As Laravel itself is MIT licenced, this project is decleared to be Open sourced in GPLv3. Feel free to pull, fork, share, modify it. But if you use the code in proprietory systems, I swear, I will find you, and, I will sue you.
